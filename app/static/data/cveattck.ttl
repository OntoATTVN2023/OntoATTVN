From a network traffic capture standpoint, it’s important to capture the right traffic for this type of detection to function (e.g., all endpoint to endpoint if possible or workstation to server and workstation to workstation). As such, it is helpful to have a centralized server area where it is possible to monitor communications between servers and endpoints.Analytic 1 and 2 are very similar, with the key difference being that Implementation 2 is intended to capture multiple attempts at lateral movement originating from the same host within a short time period (5 minutes).Analytic 1 is indication of an SMB file write to a Windows Admin File Share: ADMIN$ or C$Analytic 2 is observed originating from the same host, regardless of write-attempts and regardless of whether or not any connection is successful —just connection attempts— within a specified period of time.From a network traffic capture standpoint, it’s important to capture the right traffic for this type of detection to function (e.g., all endpoint to endpoint if possible or workstation to server and workstation to workstation).

Unlike SMB Reads, SMB Write requests typically require an additional level of access, resulting in less activity. Focusing on SMB Write activity narrows the field to looking at techniques associated with actively changing remote hosts, instead of passively reading files.The logic for Implementation 2 is based around detection of new processes that were created from a file written to an SMB share. First, a file is remotely written to a host via an SMB share; then, a variety of Execution techniques can be used to remotely establish execution of the file or script. To detect this behavior, look for files that are written to a host over SMB and then later run directly as a process or in the command line arguments.

When remote WMI requests are over RPC it connects to a DCOM interface within the RPC groupnetsvcs. To detect this activity, a sensor is needed at the network level that can decode RPC traffic or on the host where the communication can be detected more natively, such as Event Tracing for Windows. Using wireshark/tshark decoders, the WMI interfaces can be extracted so that WMI activity over RPC can be detected. Although the description details how to detect remote WMI precisely, a decent estimate has been to look for the string RPCSS within the initial RPC connection on 135/tcp. It returns a superset of this activity, and will trigger on all DCOM-related services running within RPC, which is likely to also be activity that should be detected between hosts. More about RPCSS at : rpcss_dcom_interfaces.htmlAfter the WMI connection has been initialized, a process can be remotely launched using the command:wmic /node: process call create , which is detected in the third Detection Pseudocode.This leaves artifacts at both a network (RPC) and process (command line) level. Whenwmic.exe(or the schtasks API) is used to remotely create processes, Windows uses RPC (135/tcp) to communicate with the the remote machine.After RPC authenticates, the RPC endpoint mapper opens a high port connection, through which the schtasks Remote Procedure Call is actually implemented.

This analytic looks for these two events happening in sequence, so that the network connection and target process are output.Certain strings can be identifiers of the WMI by looking up the interface UUID forIRemUnknown2in different formats- UUID00000143-0000-0000-c000-000000000046(decoded)- Hex43 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 c0 00 00 00 00 00 00 46(raw)- ASCIICF(printable text only)This identifier is present three times during the RPC request phase. Any sensor that has access to the byte code as raw, decoded, or ASCII could implement this analytic. The transfer syntax is- UUID8a885d04-1ceb-11c9-9fe8-08002b104860(decoded)- Hex04 5d 88 8a eb 1c c9 11 9f e8 08 00 2b 10 48 60(raw)- ASCII`]+H``(printable text only)Thus, a great ASCII based signature is-CF]+HCFCFhost Note: To detect WMI over RPC (using DCOM), a sensor needs to exist that has the insight into individual connections and can actually decode and make sense of RPC traffic. Specifically, WMI can be detected by looking at RPC traffic where the target interface matches that of WMI, which is IRemUnknown2. Look for instances of the WMI querying in network traffic, and find the cases where a process is launched immediately after a connection is seen. This essentially merges the request to start a remote process via WMI with the process execution. If other processes are spawned from wmiprvse.exe in this time frame, it is possible for race conditions to occur, and the wrong process may be merged. If this is the case, it may be useful to look deeper into the network traffic to see if the desired command can be extracted.Analytic 1 - Remote WMI over RPCwmi_flow = filter network_flow where (dest_port == 135 and proto_info.rpc_interface == IRemUnknown2)Analytic 2 : Remotely Launched Executables via WMIwmi_children = filter processes where (parent_process == wmiprvse.exe)wmi_flow = filter network flow where (src_port ≥ 49152 and dest_port ≥ 49152 and proto_info.rpc_interface == IRemUnknown2)remote_wmi_process = join wmi_children, wmi_flow where (wmi_flow.time < wmi_children.time < wmi_flow.time + 1 sec and wmi_flow.hostname == wmi_children.hostname" ;

Windows API calls such asCreateRemoteThreadand those that can be used to modify memory within another process, such asVirtualAllocEx/WriteProcessMemory, may be used for this technique.Search for remote thread creations that start at LoadLibraryA or LoadLibraryW. Depending on the tool, it may provide additional information about the DLL string that is an argument to the function. If there is any security software that legitimately injects DLLs, it must be carefully whitelisted.Microsoft Windows allows for processes to remotely create threads within other processes of the same privilege level. This functionality is provided via the Windows API CreateRemoteThread. Both Windows and third-party software use this ability for legitimate purposes. For example, the Windows process csrss.exe creates threads in programs to send signals to registered callback routines. Both adversaries and host-based security software use this functionality to inject DLLs, but for very different purposes. An adversary is likely to inject into a program to evade defenses or bypass User Account Control, but a security program might do this to gain increased monitoring of API calls. One of the most common methods of DLL Injection is through the Windows API LoadLibrary.Allocate memory in the target program with VirtualAllocExWrite the name of the DLL to inject into this program with WriteProcessMemoryCreate a new thread and set its entry point to LoadLibrary using the API CreateRemoteThread.This behavior can be detected by looking for thread creations across processes, and resolving the entry point to determine the function name. If the function is LoadLibraryA or LoadLibraryW, then the intent of the remote thread is clearly to inject a DLL. When this is the case, the source process must be examined so that it can be ignored when it is both expected and a trusted process.Analytic 1 - DLL Injection via Load Libraryremote_thread = filter (start_function == LoadLibraryA or start_function == LoadLibraryW)remote_thread = filter (src_image_path != C:PathToTrustedProgram.exe)" ;

PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included in the Windows operating system. Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code. Examples include the Start-Process cmdlet which can be used to run an executable and the Invoke-Command cmdlet which runs a command locally or on a remote computer (though administrator permissions are required to use PowerShell to connect to remote systems)." ;

                         "If proper execution policy is set, adversaries will likely be able to define their own execution policy if they obtain administrator or system access, either through the Registry or at the command line. This change in policy on a system may be a way to detect malicious use of PowerShell. If PowerShell is not used in an environment, then simply looking for PowerShell execution may detect malicious activity. It is also beneficial to turn on PowerShell logging to gain increased fidelity in what occurs during execution (which is applied to .NET invocations).PowerShell 5.0 introduced enhanced logging capabilities, and some of those features have since been added to PowerShell 4.0. Earlier versions of PowerShell do not have many logging features.An organization can gather PowerShell execution details in a data analytic platform to supplement it with other data." ,

When an eventlog is cleared, a new event is created that alerts that the eventlog was cleared. For Security logs, its event code 1100 and 1102. For System logs, it is event code 104.It is unlikely that event log data would be cleared during normal operations, and it is likely that malicious attackers may try to cover their tracks by clearing an event log. When an event log gets cleared, it is suspicious.This is often done using wevtutil, a legitimate tool provided by Microsoft. This action interferes with event collection and notification, and may lead to a security event going undetected, thereby potentially leading to further compromise of the network.Alerting when a Clear Event Log is generated could point to this intruder technique. Centrally collecting events has the added benefit of making it much harder for attackers to cover their tracks. Event Forwarding permits sources to forward multiple copies of a collected event to multiple collectors, thus enabling redundant event collection. Using a redundant event collection model can minimize the single point of failure risk.Attackers may set the option of the sources of events withLimit-EventLog -LogName Security -OverflowAction DoNotOverwriteto not delete old Evenlog when the .evtx is full. By default the Security Log size is configured with the minimum value of 20 480KB (~23 000 EventLog). So if this option is enabled, all the new EventLogs will be automatically deleted. We can detect this behavior with the Security EventLog 1104.Attackers may delete .evtx withdel C:WindowsSystem32winevtlogsSecurity.evtxorRemove-Item C:WindowsSystem32winevtlogsSecurity.evtxafter having disabled and stopped the Eventlog service.

This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. Port Knocking), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics.

There are varying motivations behind this action - they may not want some files/objects to be changed on systems for persistence reasons and therefore provide admin only rights; also, they may want files to be accessible with lower levels of permissions.Windows environment logs can be noisy, so we take the following into consideration:We need to exclude events generated by the local system (subject security ID  NT AUTHORITYSYSTEM ) and focus on actual user events.When a permission modification is made for a folder, a new event log is generated for each subfolder and file under that folder. It is advised to group logs based on handle ID or user ID.The Windows security log (event ID 4670) also includes information about the process that modifies the file permissions. It is advised to focus on uncommon process names, and it is also uncommon for real-users to perform this task without a GUI.Pseudocode Event ID is for Windows Security Log (Event ID 4670 - Permissions on an object were changed).Windows Event ID 4719 (An Attempt Was Made to Access An Object) can also be used to alert on changes to Active Directory audit policy for a system.Linux environment logs can be more noisy than the Windows-specific implementation, although Linux does not generate logs for system triggered activities like in Windows.

One of the most common methods is via the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM), which allows authorized users to remotely create and modify services. Several tools, such asPsExec, use this functionality.When a client remotely communicates with the Service Control Manager, there are two observable behaviors. First, the client connects to the RPC Endpoint Mapper over 135/tcp. This handles authentication, and tells the client what port the endpoint—in this case the SCM—is listening on. Then, the client connects directly to the listening port on services.exe. If the request is to start an existing service with a known command line, the the SCM process will run the corresponding command.This compound behavior can be detected by looking for services.exe receiving a network connection and immediately spawning a child process.Analytic 1 - Remotely Launched Executables via Servicesservice = filter process where (parent_exe == services.exe)remote_start = join (flow, service ) where ( flow.hostname == service.hostname and flow.pid == service.pid and (flow.time < service.time < flow.time + 1 second))" ,

Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.Windows runs the Service Control Manager (SCM) within the process services.exe. Windows launches services as independent processes or DLL loads within a svchost.exe group. To be a legitimate service, a process (or DLL) must have the appropriate service entry point SvcMain. If an application does not have the entry point, then it will timeout (default is 30 seconds) and the process will be killed.To survive the timeout, adversaries and red teams can create services that direct to cmd.exe with the flag /c, followed by the desired command. The /c flag causes the command shell to run a command and immediately exit. As a result, the desired program will remain running and it will report an error starting the service. This analytic will catch that command prompt instance that is used to launch the actual malicious executable. Additionally, the children and descendants of services.exe will run as a SYSTEM user by default.Note: Create a baseline of services seen over the last 30 days and a list of services seen today. Remove services in the baseline from services seen today, leaving a list of new services. Returns all processes named cmd.exe that have services.exe as a parent process.

Since an adversary does not have physical access to the machine, this technique must be run within Remote Desktop. To prevent an adversary from getting to the login screen without first authenticating, Network-Level Authentication (NLA) must be enabled. If a debugger is set up for one of the accessibility features, then it will intercept the process launch of the feature and instead execute a new command line. This analytic looks for instances of cmd.exe or powershell.exe launched directly from the logon process, winlogon.exe.Several accessibility programs can be run using the Ease of Access centersethc.exe handles StickyKeysutilman.exe is the Ease of Access menuosk.exe runs the On-Screen Keyboardnarrator.exe reads screen text over audiomagnify.exe magnifies the view of the screen near the cursorOne simple way to implement this technique is to note that in a default Windows configuration there are no spaces in the path to the system32 folder. If the accessibility programs are ever run with a Debugger set, then Windows will launch the Debugger process and append the command line to the accessibility program. As a result, a space is inserted in the command line before the path. Looking for any instances of a space in the command line before the name of an accessibility program will help identify when Debuggers are set.The Windows Registry location HKLMSoftwareMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionImage File Execution Options allows for parameters to be set for applications during execution. One feature used by malicious actors is the Debugger option. When a key has this value enabled, a Debugging command line can be specified. Windows will launch the Debugging command line, and pass the original command line in as an argument. Adversaries can set a Debugger for Accessibility Applications. The analytic looks for the original command line as an argument to the Debugger. When the strings sethc.exe, utilman.exe, osk.exe, narrator.exe, and Magnify.exe are detected in the arguments, but not as the main executable, it is very likely that a Debugger is set.Note: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The Analytic example looks for any creation of common accessibility processes such as sethc.exe but does no other filtering, which may result in false positives. Therefore, we recommend tuning any such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., testing the name of the parent process) that helps reduce false positives.Analytic 2 could depend on the possibility of the known strings used as arguments for other applications used in the day-to-day environment. Although the chance of the string sethc.exe being used as an argument for another application is unlikely, it still is a possibility.Analytic 1 : Command Launched from Winlogonprocesses = filter process where ((event_id == 1 OR event_id=4688) AND (parent_exe == winlogon.exe and exe == cmd.exe) AND command_line=(sethc.exe OR utilman.exe OR osk.exe OR narrator.exe OR magnify.exe)Analytic 2 : Debuggers for Accessibility Applicationsdebuggers = filter process where (command_line match $..(sethcutilmanosknarratormagnify).exe)" ;

The built-in utility reg.exe provides a command-line interface to the registry, so that queries and modifications can be performed from a shell, such as cmd.exe.

Cyber actors frequently escalate to the SYSTEM account after gaining entry to a Windows host, to enable them to carry out various attacks more effectively. Tools such as Meterpreter, Cobalt Strike, and Empire carry out automated steps to Get System, which is the same as switching over to the System user account. Most of these tools utilize multiple techniques to try and attain SYSTEM: in the first technique, they create a named pipe and connects an instance of cmd.exe to it, which allows them to impersonate the security context of cmd.exe, which is SYSTEM. In the second technique, a malicious DLL is injected into a process that is running as SYSTEM; the injected DLL steals the SYSTEM token and applies it where necessary to escalate privileges.

There are different ways to perform this attack.1. The first one is to create the Registry Key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlMiniNt. This action will not generate Security EventLog 4657 or Sysmon EventLog 13 because the value of the key remains empty. However, if an attacker uses powershell to perform this attack (and not cmd), a Security EventLog 4663 will be generated (but 4663 generates a lot of noise).2. The second way is to disable the service EventLog (display name Windows Event Log). After disabed, attacker must reboot the system. The action of disabling or put in manual the service will modify the Registry Key value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesEventLogstart, therefore Security EventLog 4657 or Sysmon EventLog 13 will be generated on the system.3. The third way is linked with the second. By default, the EventLog service cannot be stopped. If an attacker tries to stop the service, this one will restart immediately. Why ? Because to stop completely, this service must stop others, one in particular called netprofm (display name Network List Service). This service remains running until it is disabled. So Attacker must either disable EventLog and after to stop it or disable netprofm and after stop EventLog. Only stopping the service (even as admin) will not have an effect on the EventLog service because of the link with netprofm. Security EventLog 1100 will log the stop of the EventLog service (but also generates a lot of noise because it will generate a log everytime the system shutdown).4. The fourth way is to use auditpol.exe to modify the audit configuration and disable/modify important parameters that will lead to disable the creation of EventLog.5. The last one is to modify the Registry Key value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesEventLogSecurityfile (or other kind of log) to modify the path where the EventLog are stocked. Importantly, with this technique, the EventViewer will use the value of the Registry Key file to know where to find the Log. Thus, using the EventViewer will always show the current event logs, but the old one will be stocked in another evtx. Also, the path must be in a folder that the Eventlog process has access (like it doesn’t work if attacker set up the new path in the Desktop). Attacker can also decrease the maxsize value of the Log to force the system to rewrite on the older EventLog (but the minimum cannot be less than 1028 KB). As the Registry key is modified, Security EventLog 4657 or Sysmon EventLog 13 will be generated on the system. All of these attacks required administrative right. Attacks number three, four and five do not require a system reboot to be effective immediately.Analytic 1 - Disable Windows Event Loggingevent_log_reg_keys = filter reg_keys where Key=EventLog AND (value=Start OR value=File OR value=MaxSize)" ;

In addition to detecting a DGA domain based on the name, another more general approach for detecting a suspicious domain is to check for recently registered names or for rarely visited domains.Machine learning approaches to detecting DGA domains have been developed and have seen success in applications. One approach is to use N-Gram methods to determine a randomness score for strings used in the domain name. If the randomness score is high, and the domains are not whitelisted (CDN, etc), then it may be determined if a domain is related to a legitimate host or DGA.Another approach is to use deep learning to classify domains as DGA-generated]" ;

Malware is also increasingly incorporating seed values that can be unique for each instance, which would then need to be determined to extract future generated domains. In some cases, the seed that a particular sample uses can be extracted from DNS traffic. Even so, there can be thousands of possible domains generated per day; this makes it impractical for defenders to preemptively register all possible C2 domains due to the cost." ;
