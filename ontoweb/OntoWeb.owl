  <hasName rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism</hasName>
  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions. Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can perform on a machine. Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that can be considered of higher risk. An adversary can perform several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.</hasDescription>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Check for common UAC bypass weaknesses on Windows systems to be aware of the risk posture and address issues where appropriate.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">System settings can prevent applications from running that haven't been downloaded from legitimate repositories which may help mitigate some of these issues. Not allowing unsigned applications from being run may also mitigate some risk.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Applications with known vulnerabilities or known shell escapes should not have the setuid or setgid bits set to reduce potential damage if an application is compromised. Additionally, the number of programs with setuid or setgid bits set should be minimized across a system. Ensuring that the sudo tty_tickets setting is enabled will prevent this leakage across tty sessions.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Remove users from the local administrator group on systems.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">By requiring a password, even if an adversary can get terminal access, they must know the password to run anything in the sudoers file. Setting the timestamp_timeout to 0 will require the user to input their password every time sudo is executed.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The sudoers file should be strictly edited such that passwords are always required and that users can't spawn risky processes as users with higher privilege.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Although UAC bypass techniques exist, it is still prudent to use the highest enforcement level for UAC when possible and mitigate bypass opportunities that exist with techniques such as DLL Search Order Hijacking.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Limit the privileges of cloud accounts to assume, create, or impersonate additional roles, policies, and permissions to only those required. Where just-in-time access is enabled, consider requiring manual approval for temporary elevation of privileges.</hasMitigation>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor executed commands and arguments that may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor the file system for files that have the setuid or setgid bits set. On Linux, auditd can alert every time a user's actual ID and effective ID are different (this is what happens when you sudo).</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">On Linux, auditd can alert every time a user's actual ID and effective ID are different (this is what happens when you sudo). This technique is abusing normal functionality in macOS and Linux systems, but sudo has the ability to log all input and output based on theLOG_INPUTandLOG_OUTPUTdirectives in the/etc/sudoersfile. Consider monitoring for/usr/libexec/security_authtrampolineexecutions which may indicate that AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges is being executed. MacOS system logs may also indicate when AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges is being called.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Also look for any process API calls for behavior that may be indicative ofProcess Injection. Monitoring OS API callbacks for the execution can also be a way to detect this behavior but requires specialized security tooling.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor for newly executed processes that may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions. Cyber actors frequently escalate to the SYSTEM account after gaining entry to a Windows host, to enable them to carry out various attacks more effectively. Tools such as Meterpreter, Cobalt Strike, and Empire carry out automated steps to Get System, which is the same as switching over to the System user account. Most of these tools utilize multiple techniques to try and attain SYSTEM: in the first technique, they create a named pipe and connects an instance of cmd.exe to it, which allows them to impersonate the security context of cmd.exe, which is SYSTEM. In the second technique, a malicious DLL is injected into a process that is running as SYSTEM; the injected DLL steals the SYSTEM token and applies it where necessary to escalate privileges. This analytic looks for both of these techniques.Analytic 1 : Get System Elevationsuspicious_processes = filter processes where ( (parent_image_path == C:WindowsSystem32services.exe AND image_path == C:WindowsSystem32cmd.exe AND command_line == echo AND command_line == pipe*) OR (image_path == C:WindowsSystem32rundll32.exe AND command_line == ,a /p:*))</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor contextual data about a running process, which may include information such as environment variables, image name, user/owner that may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Log cloud API calls to assume, create, or impersonate additional roles, policies, and permissions. Review uses of just-in-time access to ensure that any justifications provided are valid and only expected actions were taken.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">There are many ways to perform UAC bypasses when a user is in the local administrator group on a system, so it may be difficult to target detection on all variations. Efforts should likely be placed on mitigation and collecting enough information on process launches and actions that could be performed before and after a UAC bypass is performed. Some UAC bypass methods rely on modifying specific, user-accessible Registry settings. Analysts should monitor Registry settings for unauthorized changes.</hasDetection>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls. Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.</hasDescription>

This setting should be defined for the local system account only.

Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives. Common operating system file deletion commands such as del and rm often only remove pointers to files without wiping the contents of the files themselves, making the files recoverable by proper forensic methodology. This behavior is distinct from Disk Content Wipe and Disk Structure Wipe because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.</hasDescription>

Command and control (C2) information can be encoded using a standard data encoding system. Use of data encoding may adhere to existing protocol specifications and includes use of ASCII, Unicode, Base64, MIME, or other binary-to-text and character encoding systems.

Signatures are often for unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the specific obfuscation technique used by a particular adversary or tool, and will likely be different across various malware families and versions. Adversaries will likely change tool C2 signatures over time or construct protocols in such a way as to avoid detection by common defensive tools. </hasMitigation>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information. Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, or direct access to the target information. Adversaries may also abuse external sharing features to share sensitive documents with recipients outside of the organization.</hasDescription>

  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information. Information repositories generally have a considerably large user base, detection of malicious use can be non-trivial. At minimum, access to information repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user based anomalies.</hasDetection>

Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Network Analysis frameworks such as Zeek can be used to capture, decode, and alert on network protocols such as SMB that revolve around network shares. Although there may be more native ways to detect detailed SMB events on the host, they can be extracted out of network traffic. With the right protocol decoders, port 445 traffic can be filtered and even the file path (relative to the share) can be retrieved.Looking at this activity more closely to obtain an adequate sense of situational awareness may make it possible to detect adversaries moving between hosts in a way that deviates from normal activity. Because SMB traffic is heavy in many environments, this analytic may be difficult to turn into something that can be used to quickly detect an APT. In some cases, it may make more sense to run this analytic in a forensic fashion. Looking through and filtering its output after an intrusion has been discovered may be helpful in identifying the scope of compromise.Analytic 1 - SMB Events Monitoringsmb_events = filter flow where (dest_port == 445 and protocol == smb)smb_events.file_name = smb_events.proto_info.file_name</hasDetection>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may use Obfuscated Files or Information to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis. They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it. Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware or by using utilities present on the system.</hasDescription>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor for changes made to files for unexpected modifications that attempt to hide artifacts. On Windows, Event ID 4663 (Security Log - An attempt was made to access an object) can be used to alert on suspicious file accesses (e.g., attempting to write to a file which shouldn’t be further modified) that may coincide with attempts to hide artifacts.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor for newly executed processes that attempt to hide artifacts of an intrusion, such as common archive file applications and extensions (ex: Zip and RAR archive tools), and correlate with other suspicious behavior to reduce false positives from normal user and administrator behavior.CertUtil.exe may be used to encode and decode a file, including PE and script code. Encoding will convert a file to base64 with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE----- tags. Malicious usage will include decoding an encoded file that was downloaded. Once decoded, it will be loaded by a parallel process. Note that there are two additional command switches that may be used - encodehex and decodehex. Similarly, the file will be encoded in HEX and later decoded for further execution. During triage, identify the source of the file being decoded. Review its contents or execution behavior for further analysis.Analytic Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The analytic is oriented around the creation of CertUtil.exe processes, which may be used to encode and decode files, including PE and script code. Malicious usage will include decoding a encoded file that was downloaded. Once decoded, it will be loaded by a parallel process.Analytic 1 - CertUtil with Decode Argumentprocesses = filter processes where ( (event_id == 1 OR event_id == 4688) AND exe =C:WindowsSystem32certutil.exe AND command_line =decode)</hasDetection>

  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In an Exchange environment, Administrators can use Get-InboxRule to discover and remove potentially malicious auto-forwarding rules.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In an Exchange environment, Administrators can use Get-InboxRule / Remove-InboxRule and Get-TransportRule / Remove-TransportRule to discover and remove potentially malicious auto-fowarding and transport rules. In addition to this, a MAPI Editor can be utilized to examine the underlying database structure and discover any modifications/tampering of the properties of auto-forwarding rules.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Use of encryption provides an added layer of security to sensitive information sent over email.

  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Detection is challenging because all messages forwarded because of an auto-forwarding rule have the same presentation as a manually forwarded message. It is also possible for the user to not be aware of the addition of such an auto-forwarding rule and not suspect that their account has been compromised; email-forwarding rules alone will not affect the normal usage patterns or operations of the email account. Auto-forwarded messages generally contain specific detectable artifacts that may be present in the header; such artifacts would be platform-specific. Examples includeX-MS-Exchange-Organization-AutoForwardedset to true,X-MailFwdByandX-Forwarded-To. TheforwardingSMTPAddressparameter used in a forwarding process that is managed by administrators and not by user actions. All messages for the mailbox are forwarded to the specified SMTP address. However, unlike typical client-side rules, the message does not appear as forwarded in the mailbox; it appears as if it were sent directly to the specified destination mailbox.High volumes of emails that bear theX-MS-Exchange-Organization-AutoForwardedheader (indicating auto-forwarding) without a corresponding number of emails that match the appearance of a forwarded message may indicate that further investigation is needed at the administrator level rather than user-level.</hasDetection>

Some embedded network device platforms may have the capability to calculate the checksum of the file, while others may not. Even for those platforms that have the capability, it is recommended to download a copy of the file to a trusted computer to calculate the checksum with software that is not compromised.Many vendors of embedded network devices can provide advanced debugging support that will allow them to work with device owners to validate the integrity of the operating system running in memory.

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.</hasDescription>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Some endpoint security solutions can be configured to block some types of process injection based on common sequences of behavior that occur during the injection process. For example, on Windows 10, Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules may prevent Office applications from code injection. </hasMitigation>

Windows API calls such asCreateRemoteThread,SuspendThread/SetThreadContext/ResumeThread,QueueUserAPC/NtQueueApcThread, and those that can be used to modify memory within another process, such asVirtualAllocEx/WriteProcessMemory, may be used for this technique.Monitoring for Linux specific calls such as the ptrace system call should not generate large amounts of data due to their specialized nature, and can be a very effective method to detect some of the common process injection methods.</hasDetection>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between systems or act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including HTRAN, ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion. Adversaries may chain together multiple proxies to further disguise the source of malicious traffic.</hasDescription>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Traffic to known anonymity networks and C2 infrastructure can be blocked through the use of network allow and block lists.

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media's firmware itself.</hasDescription>

  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Enforce role-based access control to limit accounts to the least privileges they require. A Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) can be used to set usage policies and manage user permissions on cloud applications to prevent access to application access tokens. In Kubernetes applications, set automountServiceAccountToken: false in the YAML specification of pods that do not require access to service account tokens.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Users need to be trained to not authorize third-party applications they don’t recognize. The user should pay particular attention to the redirect URL: if the URL is a misspelled or convoluted sequence of words related to an expected service or SaaS application, the website is likely trying to spoof a legitimate service. Users should also be cautious about the permissions they are granting to apps. For example, offline access and access to read emails should excite higher suspicions because adversaries can utilize SaaS APIs to discover credentials and other sensitive communications.</hasMitigation>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Administrators should set up monitoring to trigger automatic alerts when policy criteria are met. For example, using a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), admins can create a High severity app permissions policy that generates alerts if apps request high severity permissions or send permissions requests for too many users.Security analysts can hunt for malicious apps using the tools available in their CASB, identity provider, or resource provider (depending on platform.) For example, they can filter for apps that are authorized by a small number of users, apps requesting high risk permissions, permissions incongruous with the app’s purpose, or apps with old Last authorized fields. A specific app can be investigated using an activity log displaying activities the app has performed, although some activities may be mis-logged as being performed by the user. App stores can be useful resources to further investigate suspicious apps.Administrators can set up a variety of logs and leverage audit tools to monitor actions that can be conducted as a result of OAuth 2.0 access. For instance, audit reports enable admins to identify privilege escalation actions such as role creations or policy modifications, which could be actions performed after initial access.</hasDetection>

Kerberos is an authentication protocol widely used in modern Windows domain environments. In Kerberos environments, referred to as realms, there are three basic participants: client, service, and Key Distribution Center (KDC). Clients request access to a service and through the exchange of Kerberos tickets, originating from KDC, they are granted access after having successfully authenticated. The KDC is responsible for both authentication and ticket granting. Adversaries may attempt to abuse Kerberos by stealing tickets or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.</hasDescription>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">For containing the impact of a previously generated golden ticket, reset the built-in KRBTGT account password twice, which will invalidate any existing golden tickets that have been created with the KRBTGT hash and other Kerberos tickets derived from it.

They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using OS Credential Dumping. The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file directory ownership, session information, and system logs. Adversaries may use the information from System Owner User Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and or attempts specific actions.</hasDescription>

Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. Port Knocking), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics.

  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor network traffic for WMI connections for potential use to remotely edit configuration, start services, or query files. When remote WMI requests are over RPC it connects to a DCOM interface within the RPC groupnetsvcs. To detect this activity, a sensor is needed at the network level that can decode RPC traffic or on the host where the communication can be detected more natively, such as Event Tracing for Windows. Using wireshark/tshark decoders, the WMI interfaces can be extracted so that WMI activity over RPC can be detected. Although the description details how to detect remote WMI precisely, a decent estimate has been to look for the string RPCSS within the initial RPC connection on 135/tcp. It returns a superset of this activity, and will trigger on all DCOM-related services running within RPC, which is likely to also be activity that should be detected between hosts. More about RPCSS at : rpcss_dcom_interfaces.htmlAfter the WMI connection has been initialized, a process can be remotely launched using the command:wmic /node: process call create , which is detected in the third Detection Pseudocode.This leaves artifacts at both a network (RPC) and process (command line) level. Whenwmic.exe(or the schtasks API) is used to remotely create processes, Windows uses RPC (135/tcp) to communicate with the the remote machine.After RPC authenticates, the RPC endpoint mapper opens a high port connection, through which the schtasks Remote Procedure Call is actually implemented. With the right packet decoders, or by looking for certain byte streams in raw data, these functions can be identified.When the command line is executed, it has the parent process ofC:windowssystem32wbemWmiPrvSE.exe. This analytic looks for these two events happening in sequence, so that the network connection and target process are output.Certain strings can be identifiers of the WMI by looking up the interface UUID forIRemUnknown2in different formats- UUID00000143-0000-0000-c000-000000000046(decoded)- Hex43 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 c0 00 00 00 00 00 00 46(raw)- ASCIICF(printable text only)This identifier is present three times during the RPC request phase. Any sensor that has access to the byte code as raw, decoded, or ASCII could implement this analytic. The transfer syntax is- UUID8a885d04-1ceb-11c9-9fe8-08002b104860(decoded)- Hex04 5d 88 8a eb 1c c9 11 9f e8 08 00 2b 10 48 60(raw)- ASCII`]+H``(printable text only)Thus, a great ASCII based signature is-CF]+HCFCFhost Note: To detect WMI over RPC (using DCOM), a sensor needs to exist that has the insight into individual connections and can actually decode and make sense of RPC traffic. Specifically, WMI can be detected by looking at RPC traffic where the target interface matches that of WMI, which is IRemUnknown2. Look for instances of the WMI querying in network traffic, and find the cases where a process is launched immediately after a connection is seen. This essentially merges the request to start a remote process via WMI with the process execution. If other processes are spawned from wmiprvse.exe in this time frame, it is possible for race conditions to occur, and the wrong process may be merged. If this is the case, it may be useful to look deeper into the network traffic to see if the desired command can be extracted.Analytic 1 - Remote WMI over RPCwmi_flow = filter network_flow where (dest_port == 135 and proto_info.rpc_interface == IRemUnknown2)Analytic 2 : Remotely Launched Executables via WMIwmi_children = filter processes where (parent_process == wmiprvse.exe)wmi_flow = filter network flow where (src_port ≥ 49152 and dest_port ≥ 49152 and proto_info.rpc_interface == IRemUnknown2)remote_wmi_process = join wmi_children, wmi_flow where (wmi_flow.time &lt; wmi_children.time &lt; wmi_flow.time + 1 sec and wmi_flow.hostname == wmi_children.hostname</hasDetection>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">An adversary may abuse configurations where an application has the setuid or setgid bits set in order to get code running in a different (and possibly more privileged) user’s context. On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application binary, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively. Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them may not have the specific required privileges.</hasDescription>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Applications with known vulnerabilities or known shell escapes should not have the setuid or setgid bits set to reduce potential damage if an application is compromised.

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.</hasDescription>

This is often done by changing the registry key for system policies using reg.exe, a legitimate tool provided by Microsoft for modifying the registry via command prompt or scripts. This action interferes with UAC and may enable a threat actor to escalate privileges on the compromised system, thereby allowing further exploitation of the system.Analytic 1 : UAC Bypasspossible_uac_bypass = filter processes where ( integrity_level == High and (parent_image_path == c:windowssystem32fodhelper.exe) or (command_line == .execleanmgr.exe /autoclean) or (image_path == c:program fileswindows media playerosk.exe) or (parent_image_path == c:windowssystem32slui.exe) or (parent_command_line == 'c:windowssystem32dism.exe.xml' and image_path != c:users*appdatalocaltemp*dismhost.exe) or (command_line == 'c:windowssystem32wusa.exe/quiet*' and user != NOT_TRANSLATED and current_working_directory == c:windowssystem32 and parent_image_path != c:windowsexplorer.exe) or (parent_image_path == c:windows*dccw.exe and image_path != c:windowssystem32cttune.exe))Analytic 2 : Disable UACcmd_processes = filter processes where ( (parent_image = C:WindowsSystem32cmd.exe) AND (command_line = reg.exe%HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionPoliciesSystem%REG_DWORD /d 0%))</hasDetection>

Therefore, it is important to validate than detections for UAC Bypass are still relevant (i.e., they target non-patched implementations).Note: Sysmon Event ID 12 (Registry Key Create/Delete), Sysmon Event ID 13 (Registry Value Set), and Sysmon Event ID 14 (Registry Key and Value Rename) are useful for creating detections around Registry Key Modification in the context of UAC Bypass.</hasDetection>

The Windows security identifier (SID) is a unique value that identifies a user or group account. SIDs are used by Windows security in both security descriptors and access tokens. An account can hold additional SIDs in the SID-History Active Directory attribute , allowing inter-operable account migration between domains (e.g., all values in SID-History are included in access tokens).</hasDescription>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Clean up SID-History attributes after legitimate account migration is complete.Consider applying SID Filtering to interforest trusts, such as forest trusts and external trusts, to exclude SID-History from requests to access domain resources. SID Filtering ensures that any authentication requests over a trust only contain SIDs of security principals from the trusted domain (i.e preventing the trusted domain from claiming a user has membership in groups outside of the domain).SID Filtering of forest trusts is enabled by default, but may have been disabled in some cases to allow a child domain to transitively access forest trusts. SID Filtering of external trusts is automatically enabled on all created external trusts using Server 2003 or later domain controllers.However note that SID Filtering is not automatically applied to legacy trusts or may have been deliberately disabled to allow inter-domain access to resources.SID Filtering can be applied by:Disabling SIDHistory on forest trusts using the netdom tool (netdom trust /domain: /EnableSIDHistory:noon the domain controller)Applying SID Filter Quarantining to external trusts using the netdom tool (netdom trust/domain:/quarantine:yeson the domain controller)Applying SID Filtering to domain trusts within a single forest is not recommended as it is an unsupported configuration and can cause breaking changes.If a domain within a forest is untrustworthy then it should not be a member of the forest. In this situation it is necessary to first split the trusted and untrusted domains into separate forests where SID Filtering can be applied to an interforest trust</hasMitigation>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for execution. PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included in the Windows operating system. Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code. Examples include the Start-Process cmdlet which can be used to run an executable and the Invoke-Command cmdlet which runs a command locally or on a remote computer (though administrator permissions are required to use PowerShell to connect to remote systems).</hasDescription>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Anti-virus can be used to automatically quarantine suspicious files.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Set PowerShell execution policy to execute only signed scripts.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">It may be possible to remove PowerShell from systems when not needed, but a review should be performed to assess the impact to an environment, since it could be in use for many legitimate purposes and administrative functions.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Use application control where appropriate. PowerShell Constrained Language mode can be used to restrict access to sensitive or otherwise dangerous language elements such as those used to execute arbitrary Windows APIs or files (e.g., Add-Type).</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When PowerShell is necessary, consider restricting PowerShell execution policy to administrators. Be aware that there are methods of bypassing the PowerShell execution policy, depending on environment configuration.</hasMitigation>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">If proper execution policy is set, adversaries will likely be able to define their own execution policy if they obtain administrator or system access, either through the Registry or at the command line. This change in policy on a system may be a way to detect malicious use of PowerShell. If PowerShell is not used in an environment, then simply looking for PowerShell execution may detect malicious activity. It is also beneficial to turn on PowerShell logging to gain increased fidelity in what occurs during execution (which is applied to .NET invocations).PowerShell 5.0 introduced enhanced logging capabilities, and some of those features have since been added to PowerShell 4.0. Earlier versions of PowerShell do not have many logging features.An organization can gather PowerShell execution details in a data analytic platform to supplement it with other data.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor for loading and/or execution of artifacts associated with PowerShell specific assemblies, such as System.Management.Automation.dll (especially to unusual process names/locations).Analytic 1 - Processes loading PowerShell assembliessuspicious_processes = filter ProcessGuid, ProcessFilePath, ModulePath, FileDescription where EventId == 7 AND (ModulePath LIKE '%system.management.automation%' OR FileDescription LIKE '%system.management.automation%')</hasDetection>

This may lead to false positives when used in a production environment, so we recommend tuning any such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., looking for suspicious parent processes) that helps filter such events.- The logic for Analytic 2 is based around detecting on remote Powershell sessions. PowerShell can be used over WinRM to remotely run commands on a host. When a remote PowerShell session starts, svchost.exe executes wsmprovhost.exe.Analytic 1- Non-interactive Powershell Sessionsprocesses = filter process where ((event_id=10 OR event_id=4688) AND exe == powershell.exe AND parent_exe != explorer.exe)Analytic 2- Remote Powershell Sessionsprocesses = filter process where ((event_id=10 OR event_id=4688) AND exe == wsmprovhost.exe and parent_exe == svchost.exe)</hasDetection>

If a newly created or modified runs as a service, it may indicate APT activity. However, services are frequently installed by legitimate software. A well-tuned baseline is essential to differentiating between benign and malicious service modifications. Look for events where a file was created and then later run as a service. In these cases, a new service has been created or the binary has been modified. Many programs, such as msiexec.exe, do these behaviors legitimately and can be used to help validate legitimate service creations/modifications.Analytic 1 - Service Binary Modificationslegitimate_installers = [C:windowssystem32msiexec.exe, C:windowssyswow64msiexec.exe, ...]file_change = search File:Create,Modifyprocess = search Process:Createservice_process = filter processes where (parent_exe == services.exe)modified_service = join (search, filter) where ( file_change.time &lt; service_process.time and file_change.file_path == service_process.image_path)modified_service = filter modified_service where (modified_service.file_change.image_path not in legitimate_installers)output modified_service</hasDetection>

One of the most common methods is via the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM), which allows authorized users to remotely create and modify services. Several tools, such asPsExec, use this functionality.When a client remotely communicates with the Service Control Manager, there are two observable behaviors. First, the client connects to the RPC Endpoint Mapper over 135/tcp. This handles authentication, and tells the client what port the endpoint—in this case the SCM—is listening on. Then, the client connects directly to the listening port on services.exe. If the request is to start an existing service with a known command line, the the SCM process will run the corresponding command.This compound behavior can be detected by looking for services.exe receiving a network connection and immediately spawning a child process.Analytic 1 - Remotely Launched Executables via Servicesservice = filter process where (parent_exe == services.exe)remote_start = join (flow, service ) where ( flow.hostname == service.hostname and flow.pid == service.pid and (flow.time &lt; service.time &lt; flow.time + 1 second))</hasDetection>

Look for abnormal process call trees from known services and for execution of other commands that could relate to Discovery or other adversary techniques. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.Windows runs the Service Control Manager (SCM) within the process services.exe. Windows launches services as independent processes or DLL loads within a svchost.exe group. To be a legitimate service, a process (or DLL) must have the appropriate service entry point SvcMain. If an application does not have the entry point, then it will timeout (default is 30 seconds) and the process will be killed.To survive the timeout, adversaries and red teams can create services that direct to cmd.exe with the flag /c, followed by the desired command. The /c flag causes the command shell to run a command and immediately exit. As a result, the desired program will remain running and it will report an error starting the service. This analytic will catch that command prompt instance that is used to launch the actual malicious executable. Additionally, the children and descendants of services.exe will run as a SYSTEM user by default.Note: Create a baseline of services seen over the last 30 days and a list of services seen today. Remove services in the baseline from services seen today, leaving a list of new services. Returns all processes named cmd.exe that have services.exe as a parent process. Because this should never happen, the /c flag is redundant in the search.Analytic 1 : Service Outlier Executablesservices = filter processes where (parent_image_path == C:WindowsSystem32services.exe)historic_services = filter services (where timestamp &lt; now - 1 day AND timestamp &gt; now - 1 day)current_services = filter services (where timestamp &gt;= now - 1 day)new_services = historic_services - current_servicesAnalytic 2 : Services launching CMDsuspicious_processes = filter processes where (event_id == 1 OR event_id == 4688) AND (exe == cmd.exe and parent_exe == services.exe)</hasDetection>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to dynamically identify a destination domain for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains. This has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders to block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions.</hasDescription>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level. Malware researchers can reverse engineer malware variants that use DGAs and determine future domains that the malware will attempt to contact, but this is a time and resource intensive effort. Malware is also increasingly incorporating seed values that can be unique for each instance, which would then need to be determined to extract future generated domains. In some cases, the seed that a particular sample uses can be extracted from DNS traffic. Even so, there can be thousands of possible domains generated per day; this makes it impractical for defenders to preemptively register all possible C2 domains due to the cost.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In some cases a local DNS sinkhole may be used to help prevent DGA-based command and control at a reduced cost.</hasMitigation>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Detecting dynamically generated domains can be challenging due to the number of different DGA algorithms, constantly evolving malware families, and the increasing complexity of the algorithms. There is a myriad of approaches for detecting a pseudo-randomly generated domain name, including using frequency analysis, Markov chains, entropy, proportion of dictionary words, ratio of vowels to other characters, and more.CDN domains may trigger these detections due to the format of their domain names. In addition to detecting a DGA domain based on the name, another more general approach for detecting a suspicious domain is to check for recently registered names or for rarely visited domains.Machine learning approaches to detecting DGA domains have been developed and have seen success in applications. One approach is to use N-Gram methods to determine a randomness score for strings used in the domain name. If the randomness score is high, and the domains are not whitelisted (CDN, etc), then it may be determined if a domain is related to a legitimate host or DGA.Another approach is to use deep learning to classify domains as DGA-generated]</hasDetection>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may setup email forwarding rules to collect sensitive information. Adversaries may abuse email forwarding rules to monitor the activities of a victim, steal information, and further gain intelligence on the victim or the victim’s organization to use as part of further exploits or operations. Furthermore, email forwarding rules can allow adversaries to maintain persistent access to victim's emails even after compromised credentials are reset by administrators. Most email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including forwarding to a different recipient. These rules may be created through a local email application, a web interface, or by command-line interface. Messages can be forwarded to internal or external recipients, and there are no restrictions limiting the extent of this rule. Administrators may also create forwarding rules for user accounts with the same considerations and outcomes.</hasDescription>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Enterprise email solutions have monitoring mechanisms that may include the ability to audit auto-forwarding rules on a regular basis.</hasMitigation>

Encryption using public key cryptography requires the adversary to obtain the private certificate along with an encryption key to decrypt messages.</hasMitigation>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Detection is challenging because all messages forwarded because of an auto-forwarding rule have the same presentation as a manually forwarded message. It is also possible for the user to not be aware of the addition of such an auto-forwarding rule and not suspect that their account has been compromised; email-forwarding rules alone will not affect the normal usage patterns or operations of the email account. This is especially true in cases with hidden auto-forwarding rules. This makes it only possible to reliably detect the existence of a hidden auto-forwarding rule by examining message tracking logs or by using a MAPI editor to notice the modified rule property values.Auto-forwarded messages generally contain specific detectable artifacts that may be present in the header; such artifacts would be platform-specific. Examples include X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AutoForwarded set to true, X-MailFwdBy and X-Forwarded-To. The forwardingSMTPAddress parameter used in a forwarding process that is managed by administrators and not by user actions. All messages for the mailbox are forwarded to the specified SMTP address. However, unlike typical client-side rules, the message does not appear as forwarded in the mailbox; it appears as if it were sent directly to the specified destination mailbox.High volumes of emails that bear the X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AutoForwarded header (indicating auto-forwarding) without a corresponding number of emails that match the appearance of a forwarded message may indicate that further investigation is needed at the administrator level rather than user-level.In environments using Exchange, monitor logs for the creation or modification of mail transport rules.</hasDetection>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private. Due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA and ElGamal.</hasDescription>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious commands triggered by a user’s shell. User Unix Shells execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell executes scripts from the system ( etc) and the user’s home directory (~ ) to configure the environment. All login shells on a system use  etc profile when initiated. These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment. When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately.</hasDescription>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may establish persistence and or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features. Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (ex: when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.</hasDescription>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries can replace accessibility features binaries with alternate binaries to execute this technique. Identify and block potentially malicious software executed through accessibility features functionality by using application control  tools, like Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker,or Software Restriction Policies  where appropriate. </hasMitigation>

  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">To use this technique remotely, an adversary must use it in conjunction with RDP. Ensure that Network Level Authentication is enabled to force the remote desktop session to authenticate before the session is created and the login screen displayed. It is enabled by default on Windows Vista and later.</hasMitigation>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor executed commands and arguments that may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features. Command line invocation of tools capable of modifying the Registry for associated keys are also suspicious. Utility arguments and the binaries themselves should be monitored for changes.Note: Event ID 4104 (from the Microsoft-Windows-Powershell/Operational log) captures Powershell script blocks, which can be analyzed and used to detect on abuse of Accessibility Features.</hasDetection>

  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor newly executed processes that may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features.An adversary can use accessibility features (Ease of Access), such as StickyKeys or Utilman, to launch a command shell from the logon screen and gain SYSTEM access. Since an adversary does not have physical access to the machine, this technique must be run within Remote Desktop. To prevent an adversary from getting to the login screen without first authenticating, Network-Level Authentication (NLA) must be enabled. If a debugger is set up for one of the accessibility features, then it will intercept the process launch of the feature and instead execute a new command line. This analytic looks for instances of cmd.exe or powershell.exe launched directly from the logon process, winlogon.exe.Several accessibility programs can be run using the Ease of Access centersethc.exe handles StickyKeysutilman.exe is the Ease of Access menuosk.exe runs the On-Screen Keyboardnarrator.exe reads screen text over audiomagnify.exe magnifies the view of the screen near the cursorOne simple way to implement this technique is to note that in a default Windows configuration there are no spaces in the path to the system32 folder. If the accessibility programs are ever run with a Debugger set, then Windows will launch the Debugger process and append the command line to the accessibility program. As a result, a space is inserted in the command line before the path. Looking for any instances of a space in the command line before the name of an accessibility program will help identify when Debuggers are set.The Windows Registry location HKLMSoftwareMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionImage File Execution Options allows for parameters to be set for applications during execution. One feature used by malicious actors is the Debugger option. When a key has this value enabled, a Debugging command line can be specified. Windows will launch the Debugging command line, and pass the original command line in as an argument. Adversaries can set a Debugger for Accessibility Applications. The analytic looks for the original command line as an argument to the Debugger. When the strings sethc.exe, utilman.exe, osk.exe, narrator.exe, and Magnify.exe are detected in the arguments, but not as the main executable, it is very likely that a Debugger is set.Note: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The Analytic example looks for any creation of common accessibility processes such as sethc.exe but does no other filtering, which may result in false positives. Therefore, we recommend tuning any such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., testing the name of the parent process) that helps reduce false positives.Analytic 2 could depend on the possibility of the known strings used as arguments for other applications used in the day-to-day environment. Although the chance of the string sethc.exe being used as an argument for another application is unlikely, it still is a possibility.Analytic 1 : Command Launched from Winlogonprocesses = filter process where ((event_id == 1 OR event_id=4688) AND (parent_exe == winlogon.exe and exe == cmd.exe) AND command_line=(sethc.exe OR utilman.exe OR osk.exe OR narrator.exe OR magnify.exe)Analytic 2 : Debuggers for Accessibility Applicationsdebuggers = filter process where (command_line match $..(sethcutilmanosknarratormagnify).exe)</hasDetection>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may establish persistence and or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by application shims. The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure Framework (Application Shim) was created to allow for backward compatibility of software as the operating system codebase changes over time. For example, the application shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without rewriting code) that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with Windows 10.</hasDescription>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Microsoft released an optional patch update - KB3045645 - that will remove the auto-elevate flag within the sdbinst.exe. This will prevent use of application shimming to bypass UAC.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Changing UAC settings to Always Notify will give the user more visibility when UAC elevation is requested, however, this option will not be popular among users due to the constant UAC interruptions.</hasMitigation>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor executed commands and arguments for sdbinst.exe for potential indications of application shim abuse.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor DLL loads by processes that load user32.dll and look for DLLs that are not recognized or not normally loaded into a process.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor newly executed processs for sdbinst.exe for potential indications of application shim abuse. There are several public tools available that will detect shims that are currently available:* Shim-Process-Scanner - checks memory of every running process for any shim flags* Shim-Detector-Lite - detects installation of custom shim databases* Shim-Guard - monitors registry for any shim installations* ShimScanner - forensic tool to find active shims in memory* ShimCacheMem - Volatility plug-in that pulls shim cache from memory (note: shims are only cached after reboot)</hasDetection>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer. These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.</hasDescription>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Use auditing tools capable of detecting file system permissions abuse opportunities on systems within an enterprise and correct them. Toolkits like the PowerSploit framework contain PowerUp modules that can be used to explore systems for service file system permissions weaknesses.</hasMitigation>

To disable installer detection, instead add: EnableInstallerDetection=dword:00000000. This may prevent potential elevation of privileges through exploitation during the process of UAC detecting the installer, but will allow the installation process to continue without being logged. </hasMitigation>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries. During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as LD_PRELOAD on Linux or DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES on macOS. Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name. These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without changing the original library.</hasDescription>

There are different ways to perform this attack.1. The first one is to create the Registry Key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlMiniNt. This action will not generate Security EventLog 4657 or Sysmon EventLog 13 because the value of the key remains empty. However, if an attacker uses powershell to perform this attack (and not cmd), a Security EventLog 4663 will be generated (but 4663 generates a lot of noise).2. The second way is to disable the service EventLog (display name Windows Event Log). After disabed, attacker must reboot the system. The action of disabling or put in manual the service will modify the Registry Key value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesEventLogstart, therefore Security EventLog 4657 or Sysmon EventLog 13 will be generated on the system.3. The third way is linked with the second. By default, the EventLog service cannot be stopped. If an attacker tries to stop the service, this one will restart immediately. Why ? Because to stop completely, this service must stop others, one in particular called netprofm (display name Network List Service). This service remains running until it is disabled. So Attacker must either disable EventLog and after to stop it or disable netprofm and after stop EventLog. Only stopping the service (even as admin) will not have an effect on the EventLog service because of the link with netprofm. Security EventLog 1100 will log the stop of the EventLog service (but also generates a lot of noise because it will generate a log everytime the system shutdown).4. The fourth way is to use auditpol.exe to modify the audit configuration and disable/modify important parameters that will lead to disable the creation of EventLog.5. The last one is to modify the Registry Key value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesEventLogSecurityfile (or other kind of log) to modify the path where the EventLog are stocked. Importantly, with this technique, the EventViewer will use the value of the Registry Key file to know where to find the Log. Thus, using the EventViewer will always show the current event logs, but the old one will be stocked in another evtx. Also, the path must be in a folder that the Eventlog process has access (like it doesn’t work if attacker set up the new path in the Desktop). Attacker can also decrease the maxsize value of the Log to force the system to rewrite on the older EventLog (but the minimum cannot be less than 1028 KB). As the Registry key is modified, Security EventLog 4657 or Sysmon EventLog 13 will be generated on the system. All of these attacks required administrative right. Attacks number three, four and five do not require a system reboot to be effective immediately.Analytic 1 - Disable Windows Event Loggingevent_log_reg_keys = filter reg_keys where Key=EventLog AND (value=Start OR value=File OR value=MaxSize)</hasDetection>

In particular, Powershell has a built-in Clear-EventLog cmdlet that allows for a specified log to be cleared.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor for unexpected deletion of Windows event logs (via native binaries) and may also generate an alterable event (Event ID 1102: The audit log was cleared). When an eventlog is cleared, a new event is created that alerts that the eventlog was cleared. For Security logs, its event code 1100 and 1102. For System logs, it is event code 104.It is unlikely that event log data would be cleared during normal operations, and it is likely that malicious attackers may try to cover their tracks by clearing an event log. When an event log gets cleared, it is suspicious.This is often done using wevtutil, a legitimate tool provided by Microsoft. This action interferes with event collection and notification, and may lead to a security event going undetected, thereby potentially leading to further compromise of the network.Alerting when a Clear Event Log is generated could point to this intruder technique. Centrally collecting events has the added benefit of making it much harder for attackers to cover their tracks. Event Forwarding permits sources to forward multiple copies of a collected event to multiple collectors, thus enabling redundant event collection. Using a redundant event collection model can minimize the single point of failure risk.Attackers may set the option of the sources of events withLimit-EventLog -LogName Security -OverflowAction DoNotOverwriteto not delete old Evenlog when the .evtx is full. By default the Security Log size is configured with the minimum value of 20 480KB (~23 000 EventLog). So if this option is enabled, all the new EventLogs will be automatically deleted. We can detect this behavior with the Security EventLog 1104.Attackers may delete .evtx withdel C:WindowsSystem32winevtlogsSecurity.evtxorRemove-Item C:WindowsSystem32winevtlogsSecurity.evtxafter having disabled and stopped the Eventlog service. As the EventLog service is disabled and stopped, the .evtx files are no longer used by this service and can be deleted. The new EventLog will be Unavailable until the configuration is reset.Attackers may use the powershell commandRemove-EventLog -LogName Securityto unregister source of events that are part of Windows (Application, Security…). This command deletes the security EventLog (which also generates EventId 1102) but the new Eventlogs are still recorded until the system is rebooted . After the System is rebooted, the Security log is unregistered and doesn’t log any new Eventlog. However logs generated between the command and the reboot are still available in the .evtx file.Analytic 1 - User Activity from Clearing Event Logscleared_logs = filter log_files where ((log_name = Security) AND (event_id = 1100 OR event_id =1102 OR event_id = 1104)) OR (log_name = System AND event_code = 104</hasDetection>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may match or approximate the name or location of legitimate files or resources when naming placing them. This is done for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may be done by placing an executable in a commonly trusted directory (ex: under System32) or giving it the name of a legitimate, trusted program (ex: svchost.exe). In containerized environments, this may also be done by creating a resource in a namespace that matches the naming convention of a container pod or cluster. Alternatively, a file or container image name given may be a close approximation to legitimate programs images or something innocuous.</hasDescription>

  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Periodically review the hybrid identity solution in use for any discrepancies. For example, review all PTA agents in the Azure Management Portal to identify any unwanted or unapproved ones. If ADFS is in use, review DLLs and executable files in the AD FS and Global Assembly Cache directories to ensure that they are signed by Microsoft. Note that in some cases binaries may be catalog-signed, which may cause the file to appear unsigned when viewing file properties.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Integrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the risk of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may be used for additional Tactic such as initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information. MFA can also be used to restrict access to cloud resources and APIs.</hasMitigation>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Limit on-premises accounts with access to the hybrid identity solution in place. For example, limit Azure AD Global Administrator accounts to only those required, and ensure that these are dedicated cloud-only accounts rather than hybrid ones.</hasMitigation>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Enable security auditing to collect logs from hybrid identity solutions. For example, monitor sign-ins to the Azure AD Application Proxy Connector, which are typically generated only when a new PTA Agent is added.If AD FS is in use, review the logs for event ID 501, which specifies all EKU attributes on a claim, and raise alerts on any values that are not configured in your environment.</hasDetection>

This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address. This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector. An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim. Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used. Likewise, one or more reflectors may be used to focus traffic on the target. This Network DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network.</hasDescription>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When flood volumes exceed the capacity of the network connection being targeted, it is typically necessary to intercept the incoming traffic upstream to filter out the attack traffic from the legitimate traffic. Such defenses can be provided by the hosting Internet Service Provider (ISP) or by a 3rd party such as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or providers specializing in DoS mitigations.</hasMitigation>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Detection of Network DoS can sometimes be achieved before the traffic volume is sufficient to cause impact to the availability of the service, but such response time typically requires very aggressive monitoring and responsiveness or services provided by an upstream network service provider. Monitor for logging, messaging, and other artifacts highlighting the health of host sensors (ex: metrics, errors, and/or exceptions from logging applications)</hasDetection>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection to conceal their code. Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable. Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory. Virtual machine software protection translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. A virtual machine is then called to run this code.</hasDescription>

PowerShell scripts also exist that contain credential dumping functionality, such as PowerSploit's Invoke-Mimikatz module,which may require additional logging features to be configured in the operating system to collect necessary information for analysis.Note: Event ID 4104 from the Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational log captures Powershell script blocks, whose contents can be further analyzed to determine if they’re performing LSASS dumping.</hasDetection>

Dynamic malware analysis tools (i.e., sandboxes) can be used to trace the execution, including OS API calls, for a single PE binary.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor for unexpected processes interacting with LSASS.exe.Common credential dumpers such as Mimikatz access LSASS.exe by opening the process, locating the LSA secrets key, and decrypting the sections in memory where credential details are stored. Credential dumpers may also use methods for reflectiveProcess Injectionto reduce potential indicators of malicious activity.Usage of Procdump and Windows Task Manager for LSASS dumping can also be detected via process creation events, since they both have a predictable set of command-line arguments (i.e., for specifying the process to be dumped).Note: Sysmon process access events (Event ID 10) can be extremely noisy, which necessitates tweaking the Sysmon configuration file. We recommend taking an approach analogous to that of the Sysmon Modular Configuration project (https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular) and filtering out any benign processes in your environment that produce large volumes of process access events.The GrantedAccess value in the below analytic for Mimikatz is meant to be used solely as an illustrative example of detecting Mimikatz LSASS access. However, actual GrantedAccess values change over time with different versions of Mimikatz and therefore detection engineers need to verify the accuracy of any GrantedAccess values that their analytics are using.Analytic 1 - Mimikatzprocesses = filter processes where (event_id == 10 AND target_process == *lsass.exe AND granted_access == 0x1410)Analytic 2 - Procdumpprocesses = filter processes where (event_id == 10 AND target_process == lsass.exe AND source_process == procdump.exe)Analytic 3 - Windows Task Managerprocesses = filter processes where (event_id == 10 AND target_process == *lsass.exe AND source_process == c:windows*taskmgr.exe)</hasDetection>

Therefore, because the LSASS process ID is non-deterministic, the MiniDump detection isn’t specific to LSASS dumping and may need to be tuned to help reduce false positives.Analytic 1 - Procdumpprocesses = filter processes where ((event_id == 1 OR event_id == 4688) AND exe == procdump.exe and command_line == lsass*)Analytic 2 - MiniDump via rundll32processes = filter processes where ((event_id == 1 OR event_id == 4688) AND exe == rundll32.exe and command_line == comsvcs.dll MiniDump</hasDetection>

  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitoring Windows API calls indicative of the various types of code injection may generate a significant amount of data and may not be directly useful for defense unless collected under specific circumstances for known bad sequences of calls, since benign use of API functions may be common and difficult to distinguish from malicious behavior. Windows API calls such asCreateRemoteThreadand those that can be used to modify memory within another process, such asVirtualAllocEx/WriteProcessMemory, may be used for this technique.Search for remote thread creations that start at LoadLibraryA or LoadLibraryW. Depending on the tool, it may provide additional information about the DLL string that is an argument to the function. If there is any security software that legitimately injects DLLs, it must be carefully whitelisted.Microsoft Windows allows for processes to remotely create threads within other processes of the same privilege level. This functionality is provided via the Windows API CreateRemoteThread. Both Windows and third-party software use this ability for legitimate purposes. For example, the Windows process csrss.exe creates threads in programs to send signals to registered callback routines. Both adversaries and host-based security software use this functionality to inject DLLs, but for very different purposes. An adversary is likely to inject into a program to evade defenses or bypass User Account Control, but a security program might do this to gain increased monitoring of API calls. One of the most common methods of DLL Injection is through the Windows API LoadLibrary.Allocate memory in the target program with VirtualAllocExWrite the name of the DLL to inject into this program with WriteProcessMemoryCreate a new thread and set its entry point to LoadLibrary using the API CreateRemoteThread.This behavior can be detected by looking for thread creations across processes, and resolving the entry point to determine the function name. If the function is LoadLibraryA or LoadLibraryW, then the intent of the remote thread is clearly to inject a DLL. When this is the case, the source process must be examined so that it can be ignored when it is both expected and a trusted process.Analytic 1 - DLL Injection via Load Libraryremote_thread = filter (start_function == LoadLibraryA or start_function == LoadLibraryW)remote_thread = filter (src_image_path != C:PathToTrustedProgram.exe)</hasDetection>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may hijack a legitimate user’s remote desktop session to move laterally within an environment. Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems. It allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system. Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as Remote Desktop Services (RDS).</hasDescription>

  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor service creation that uses cmd.exe /k or cmd.exe /c in its arguments to detect RDP session hijacking. Windows PowerShell log Event ID 4104 (PS script execution) can be used to capture PowerShell script block contents which may contain commands used as a precursor to RDP hijacking. For example, the following command in a PowerShell script block may be used to enumerate the systems on a network which have RDP access:Find-DomainLocalGroupMember -GroupName Remote Desktop Users | select -expand ComputerName.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Use of RDP may be legitimate, depending on the network environment and how it is used. Other factors, such as access patterns and activity that occurs after a remote login, may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior with RDP. Windows security log Event ID 4624 (An account was successfully logged on) is generated when a user logs onto a remote machine using RDP.Correlating logon session creation events with RDP network flows can provide a clearer picture of RDP activity and serve as a useful starting point for investigating suspicious RDP connections.</hasDetection>

Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)). Network Analysis frameworks such as Zeek can be used to capture, decode, and alert on network protocols including RDP.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. RDP sessions may be split up into multiple flows and would therefore need to be aggregated.Anomaly detection using machine learning or other methods based on baselined RDP network flows may be a viable approach to alerting on potential RDP session hijacking.</hasDetection>
  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Consider monitoring processes for tscon.exe usage. Using tscon.exe to hijack an RDP session requires SYSTEM level permissions. Therefore, we recommend also looking for Privilege Escalation techniques that may be used for this purpose in conjunction with RDP Session Hijacking.In addition to tscon.exe, mstsc.exe can similarly be used to hijack existing RDP sessions. In this case, we recommend looking for the command-line parameters of/noconsentPromptand/shadow:, which allow for stealthy hijacking of an RDP session with no prompt and without kicking off the existing session.</hasDetection>

  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor for newly constructed network connections (typically over ports 139 or 445), especially those that are sent or received by abnormal or untrusted hosts. Correlate these network connections with remote login events and associated SMB-related activity such as file transfers and remote process execution.Note: Event ID is for Zeek but can also be implemented in other Network Analysis Frameworks by parsing &amp; decoding captured SMB2 network traffic. Preference would be to detect smb2_write_response event (instead of smb2_write_request), because it would confirm the file was actually written to the remote destination. Unfortunately, Bro/Zeek does not have an event for that SMB message-type yet. From a network traffic capture standpoint, it’s important to capture the right traffic for this type of detection to function (e.g., all endpoint to endpoint if possible or workstation to server and workstation to workstation). As such, it is helpful to have a centralized server area where it is possible to monitor communications between servers and endpoints.Analytic 1 and 2 are very similar, with the key difference being that Implementation 2 is intended to capture multiple attempts at lateral movement originating from the same host within a short time period (5 minutes).Analytic 1 is indication of an SMB file write to a Windows Admin File Share: ADMIN$ or C$Analytic 2 is observed originating from the same host, regardless of write-attempts and regardless of whether or not any connection is successful —just connection attempts— within a specified period of time.From a network traffic capture standpoint, it’s important to capture the right traffic for this type of detection to function (e.g., all endpoint to endpoint if possible or workstation to server and workstation to workstation). As such, it is helpful to have a centralized server area where it is possible to monitor communications between servers and endpoints.The Service Control Manager (SCM) can be used to copy a file to the ADMIN$ share and execute it as a service.

Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Network Analysis frameworks such as Zeek can be used to capture, decode, and alert on SMB network flows.Notes:The logic for Implementation 1 is based around detecting on SMB write requests, which are often used by adversaries to move laterally to another host. Unlike SMB Reads, SMB Write requests typically require an additional level of access, resulting in less activity. Focusing on SMB Write activity narrows the field to looking at techniques associated with actively changing remote hosts, instead of passively reading files.The logic for Implementation 2 is based around detection of new processes that were created from a file written to an SMB share. First, a file is remotely written to a host via an SMB share; then, a variety of Execution techniques can be used to remotely establish execution of the file or script. To detect this behavior, look for files that are written to a host over SMB and then later run directly as a process or in the command line arguments. SMB File Writes and Remote Execution may happen normally in an environment, but the combination of the two behaviors is less frequent and more likely to indicate adversarial activity.Analytic 1 - SMB Writesmb_write = filter flow where (dest_port == 445 AND protocol == smb.write)Analytic 2 - SMB Copy and Executionremote_start = join (smb:write, process:create) where ( smb_write.hostname == process.hostname AND smb_write.file_path == process.image_path AND (smb_write.time &lt; process.time))Analytic 3 - RPC Activityrpc_mapper = filter flows where (dest_port == 135)rpc_endpoint = filter flows where (dest_port &gt;= 49152 and src_port &gt;= 49152)rpc = join rpc_mapper, rpc_endpoint where ( (rpc_mapper.time &lt; rpc_endpoint.time &lt; rpc_mapper.time + 2 seconds) and (rpc_mapper.src_ip == rpc_endpoint.src_ip and rpc_mapper.dest_ip == rpc_endpoint.dest_ip))</hasDetection>

Microsoft has a list of the possible methods that are implemented for theITaskSchedulerServiceinterface, which may be useful in differentiating read and query operations from creations and modifications.When scheduled tasks are created remotely, Windows uses RPC (135/tcp) to communicate with the Task Scheduler on the remote machine. Once an RPC connection is established, the client communicates with the Scheduled Tasks endpoint, which runs within the service group netsvcs. With packet capture and the right packet decoders or byte-stream based signatures, remote invocations of these functions can be identified.Certain strings can be identifiers of the schtasks, by looking up the interface UUID of ITaskSchedulerService in different formatsUUID86d35949-83c9-4044-b424-db363231fd0c(decoded)Hex49 59 d3 86 c9 83 44 40 b4 24 db 36 32 31 fd 0c(raw)ASCIIIYD@$621(printable bytes only)This identifier is present three times during the RPC request phase.

Using rundll32.exe, vice executing directly (i.e. Shared Modules), may avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of the rundll32.exe process because of allowlists or false positives from normal operations. Rundll32.exe is commonly associated with executing DLL payloads (ex: rundll32.exe {DLLname, DLLfunction}).</hasDescription>

  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Command arguments used with the rundll32.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the DLL being loaded. Typical command-line usage of rundll32.exe isrundll32.exe DllFile,EntryPointwhereDllFileis the name of the DLL file being called and EntryPoint the name of the entry point in the DLL file.DLLs stored on SMB shares can similarly be called using the syntax ofrundll32.exe DllFile,EntryPointwhereis the IPv4 address of the host of the SMB share.Rundll32 can also be used to execute arbitrary Javascript using the syntaxrundll32.exe javascript:&lt;code_block&gt;where &lt;code_block&gt; is a string defining the Javascript code to be executed.</hasDetection>

These parameters contain key information about the DLL payload, including the name, entry point, and optional arguments.Note: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 10 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The Analytic looks for any instances of rundll32.exe but does no other filtering, which may result in false positives. Therefore, we recommend tuning any such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., testing the name of the user that created the process) that helps reduce false positives.Analytic 1 - RunDLL32.exe Monitoringprocesses = filter process where ((event_id == 1 OR event_id == 4688) AND exe == rundll32.exe</hasDetection>

Bash keeps track of the commands users type on the command-line with the history utility. Once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the user’s .bash_history file.

  <hasDetection rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitor for user authentication attempts. From a classic Pass-The-Hash perspective, this technique uses a hash through the NTLMv1 / NTLMv2 protocol to authenticate against a compromised endpoint. This technique does not touch Kerberos. Therefore, NTLM LogonType 3 authentications that are not associated to a domain login and are not anonymous logins are suspicious. From an Over-Pass-The-Hash perspective, an adversary wants to exchange the hash for a Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT). One way to do this is by creating a sacrificial logon session with dummy credentials (LogonType 9) and then inject the hash into that session which triggers the Kerberos authentication process.</hasDetection>

  <hasDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adversaries may use voice communications to ultimately gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing voice is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that is employs the use of manipulating a user into providing access to systems through a phone call or other forms of voice communications. Spearphishing frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source (ex: Impersonation) and/or creating a sense of urgency or alarm for the recipient.</hasDescription>
  <hasMitigation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Users can be trained to identify and report social engineering techniques and spearphishing attempts, while also being suspicious of and verifying the identify of callers.</hasMitigation>
